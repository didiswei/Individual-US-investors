# Individual investors in the U.S. stock market
Data Science project identifying potential individual investors in the U.S. 

## Motivation
With the rise of easy app-based trading, the individual investor is [reshaping the U.S. stockmarket](https://www.wsj.com/articles/individual-investor-boom-reshapes-u-s-stock-market-11598866200). It would behoove any financial company to identify the primary demographics of people who are most likely to invest their money, so they can identify likely customers and also address why some segments of the population might be currently left out of the financial markets.  

## Problem Statment
Given limited demographic information, can we identify people who are likely to invest in the stock market?

## Results and Insights
Here a variety of supervised learning models are trained to understand identify investors and non-investors based on demographic information alone. This model is then used to predict the likelihood of investment for a number of test cases. Regression is also used to identify the most important demographic characteristics in identifying potential investors. 

## Languages and libraries
Python (numpy, pandas, sklearn, scipy, statsmodels, matplotlib, seaborn)
